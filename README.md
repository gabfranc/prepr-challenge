# prepr-challenge

- Recreate https://preprlabs.org/ page(after login). You can select any framework or IDE you preferred and please also provide a dark mode button. You should be able to switch between two modes:
 

## All mouseover effects need to work. But you only need to implement the following click events: search bar(doesn’t need to actually search, but it should respond to keyboard input), menu expansion/collapse, view switching between challenge/lab/project.
 
- The design needs to be responsive.
 
-  When you refresh the browser, the dark mode does not need to persist.
 
-  You do not need to consider an accessibility button in this challenge. 
 
-  Feel free to re-design this page to showcase your creativity.
 

 

### Assessment Criteria:

-  Code Quality - Is the code clear, well tested and well documented? Does the system work as expected without bugs?
 

-  Efficiency of Solution - Can this design be easily implemented? Does it appropriately communicate user experience principles?
 

-  Completeness - How well the system is completed? How many functions are actually working?
 

-  Creativity -  Is the solution visually appealing and memorable?
